## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- TailwindCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

The most important things that I learned in this project were more Next Js "hooks" and more Tailwind`s uses.
Also, some practice with Local Storage, and states management.
I'm still trying to refactor this to TypeScript (work in progress).

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Doc Page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me to remember a lot of things and learn new ones.
