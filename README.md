## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- TailwindCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

The most important things that I learned in this project were more Next Js "hooks" and more Tailwind`s uses.
Also, some practice with Local Storage, and states management.
I'm still trying to refactor this to TypeScript (work in progress).

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Doc Page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me to remember a lot of things and learn new ones.
